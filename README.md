# AWS-Honeypot-Attack-Data-Analysis

Introduction 

In today's digital landscape, organizations face continuous security threats and challenges. These include TTP flood attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malicious activity during off hours, access attempts by bad IP addresses, SQL-injection attacks aimed at extracting data, and cross-site scripting attacks (XSS) that can insert malicious code into web pages.

Honeypots are a crucial part of computer security mechanisms designed to detect, deflect, and counteract unauthorized attempts to access information systems.

Dataset Overview

The AWS Honeypot Database contains 451,581 data points collected from March 3, 2013, 9:53 PM, to September 8, 2013, 5:55 AM. This dataset provides valuable insights into cyber attacks and attempts during that period.

The primary purpose of this project is to:

Analyze the AWS Honeypot Attack Data to identify trends and correlations.

Gain insights into cyber threat vectors and potential vulnerabilities.

Create data visualizations to make the findings more accessible to the community.

Key Findings

We have identified several key findings from our analysis, including but not limited to:

Patterns in attack frequency over time.
Common attack vectors and methods.

Geographical origins of attacks.

Insights into attack patterns during off hours.
